The *Truman Show* is a 1998 movie directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. It tells the story of Truman Burbank, a man who unknowingly lives in a TV show where his life is broadcast 24/7. The film gained importance in the late 1990s, during the rise of reality TV and growing concerns about surveillance and media control. The fictional town of Seahaven reflects a controlled, artificial world created to observe and entertain.  

The film explores ideas about surveillance, control, and media ethics. It asks viewers to question how much control they have over their lives and how willing society is to invade othersâ€™ privacy for entertainment. It displays that one's <strong><em>sovereign power</em></strong> is insignificant in a controlled and surveilled environment. The creators used Truman's story to critique the growing power of the media and the ways people accept surveillance as normal.  

The movie shows how people in the late 1990s were starting to live in a world of constant observation, with media and technology shaping behavior. It reflects how surveillance can feel normal and how power works by making people act as if they're always being watched. Further, <strong><em>cultural relativism</em></strong> arises in the film, as everyone treats the concept of constant surveillance as a cultural norm even when it vastly changes who they are. It raises questions about privacy, free will, and the cost of entertainment.  

The film shows how power works through surveillance, like Foucault's idea of the Panopticon. Truman changes his behavior and asserts his <strong><em>disciplinary power</em></strong> because he feels watched, even when he doesn't know the cameras are there. Christof, the show's director, symbolizes ultimate control, showing how power can manipulate people without them realizing it. The audience watching Truman also represents how society accepts and participates in systems of control.  

One major limitation of *The Truman Show* is its unrealistic portrayal of Truman's prolonged naivety. Despite spending his entire life in an artificial environment, Truman fails to recognize the numerous inconsistencies that should have raised suspicion much earlier. Additionally, the film, released before the internet became widespread, does not account for how modern technology and outside media would make it nearly impossible to keep someone completely isolated from external influences. This oversight weakens the believability of the premise, as maintaining such a large-scale deception in today's interconnected world would be far more challenging.
