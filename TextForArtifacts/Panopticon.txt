The Panopticon, designed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century, is a model for an ideal prison. It features a circular structure with a central watchtower, allowing a single guard to observe all prisoners without them knowing they are being watched. Though few true Panopticon prisons were built, the concept became influential in discussions of surveillance, discipline, and power.

The Panopticon was intended to create a system of control in which prisoners would regulate their behavior because they could never be sure if they were being watched. Bentham saw it as an efficient way to enforce order with minimal force. By applying disciplinary power, prisoners were forced to self-regulate in fear of surveillance. Later, Michel Foucault used the Panopticon as a metaphor for modern surveillance societies, showing how power functions by making people internalize discipline.

The Panopticon represents a shift in how power operates, no longer through direct punishment but through the fear of being watched. It reflects how surveillance became a tool of control in prisons, schools, workplaces, and even digital spaces today. In modern times, forces of Authority and Governance harness surveillance to apply power rather than physical force. The concept remains valuable in understanding modern surveillance technologies, from CCTV cameras to online data tracking.

With this in mind, The Panopticon shows how power works not by using force, but by creating constant visibility that makes people control their actions. It demonstrates Foucauldian power, where surveillance is embedded in society to shape behavior, but does not display the nature of rebellion and subversion. For the concept of the Panopticon to be functional, the prisoners would have to believe in the Sovereign power of the observer and the fact that consequences will be enforced upon them. Additionally, the human nature of subversion and rebellion from a system does not allow this system to work without any errors.
