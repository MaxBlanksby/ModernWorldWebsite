CCTV cameras were first developed in the mid-20th century, with early systems used for military purposes, such as monitoring rocket tests in the 1940s. By the 1970s, CCTV became widely adopted for public and private security, especially in urban areas, banks, and retail spaces. Today, CCTV cameras are found worldwide and are a defining feature of modern surveillance, reflecting societyâ€™s growing reliance on technology to monitor and control behavior.  

The primary purpose of CCTV cameras is to deter crime, monitor activity, and provide data. They are meant to serve as tools for enforcing security and ensuring accountability. On a deeper level, they serve as a tool for government <strong><em>biopower</em></strong> as well as a <strong><em>symbolism</em></strong> to send a message to citizens to keep them in line and productive. CCTV cameras' audience includes those being watched (to alter their behavior) and those monitoring the footage (to enforce rules). Creators and users of CCTV systems generally view them as necessary for maintaining order and safety, emphasizing the role of constant surveillance in reducing risks.  

CCTV cameras show how modern societies prioritize security and control over privacy, especially as urban areas grew and crime prevention became a focus. They reflect a period when technology became a tool for centralized power, allowing authorities to monitor people more efficiently. From a Foucauldian perspective, CCTV embodies the idea of the Panopticon, where individuals regulate their behavior because they know they might be watched. Similar to the Panopticon building, where the viewer (whom the prisoners cannot see) constantly remains in surveillance, individuals change their behaviors at all times. This highlights how power operates invisibly, relying on the psychological effects of surveillance rather than direct intervention.
