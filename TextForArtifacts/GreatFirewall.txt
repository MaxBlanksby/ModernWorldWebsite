The Great Firewall, or, is the Chinese government's internet censorship system. It was developed and implemented in the late 1990s and early 2000s to control the flow of information online. It combines technologies like IP blocking, keyword filtering, and content monitoring to restrict access to foreign websites and limit digital communication within China. Furthermore, it reflects the state's desire to regulate the internet as it grew globally.

It is designed to control and restrict access to information deemed harmful or subversive to the Chinese government. Its goal is to maintain social stability, protect political authority, and promote government-approved narratives. It targets Chinese citizens, ensuring they only access information aligned with state policies while preventing influence from foreign media or organizations. The government uses authority and governance and biopower to gain information and keep citizens censored. 

The Great Firewall shows how surveillance and censorship are used as tools of state power. It reflects the Chinese government's focus on controlling public discourse and limiting external influence. It highlights Foucauldian ideas of power, where behavior and thought are shaped by restricting knowledge and creating boundaries for acceptable expression. 

The firewall is not entirely foolproof, as tech-savvy users can bypass restrictions using VPNs and other circumvention tools, creating a persistent challenge for authorities. The firewall also negatively affects businesses, both domestic and international, by slowing down internet speeds, complicating communication with global markets, and deterring foreign investment due to digital restrictions. Furthermore, enforcing such strict control requires extensive surveillance, raising ethical concerns regarding privacy violations and state overreach. While the Great Firewall serves its political purpose, these limitations highlight its inefficiencies and broader societal consequences.
