Big Brother is a fictional figure created by George Orwell in his 1949 novel 1984. He is the symbolic leader of the totalitarian regime in Oceania, though it is unclear if he is a real person. The idea of Big Brother became important in the context of Orwell’s critique of totalitarianism, especially during the Cold War when oppressive regimes used mass surveillance and propaganda. 
The Party manipulates fear of war, rebellion, and disorder to make people feel dependent on Big Brother for protection. This creates the illusion of safety and forces citizens to accept and even embrace their surveillance, believing it is necessary for stability. This belief ensures that no one questions surveillance; instead, they see it as a comfort rather than a form of oppression. The undisputed power of Big Brother creates a false sense of legitimacy in society; there is no question as to why citizens are constantly being surveilled. The fear Big Brother instills in the citizens of Oceania causes them to obey and apply their disciplinary power to themselves because they act as if they are constantly watched. This is similar to the concept of panopticon as it uses similar reasoning and strategies to control the masses.
 The illusion of surveillance in 1984 displays how power can be maintained not just through force, but also through psychological manipulation. Social stratification in 1984 reinforced the Party’s control by ensuring that each class: the Inner Party, the Outer Party, and the Proles remained in its designated place, preventing unity or rebellion. Its value lies in maintaining a rigid hierarchy where the privileged few rule unchallenged, the middle class is kept under strict surveillance, and the lower class remains ignorant of its oppression, making true resistance impossible. 
While the Party claims to prevent crime and rebellion, it creates a constant state of fear, ensuring that no one truly feels safe. Additionally, Big Brother acts as a guardian but frequently harms and silences the citizens.
