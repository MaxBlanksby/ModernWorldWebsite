Singapore's smart city surveillance system is part of the Safe City Initiative, launched in the 2010s to improve public safety using AI, data analytics, and real-time surveillance. It was developed by the Singapore government, in partnership with tech companies like Huawei, IBM, and local agencies. The system integrates thousands of CCTV cameras, facial recognition technology, and predictive policing algorithms to monitor public spaces and prevent crime before it happens. As one of the most technologically advanced cities in the world, Singapore pioneered this high-tech, low-crime approach to urban security.

The system aims to detect and prevent crimes before they happen. The AI monitors public areas for suspicious behavior, such as loitering, unattended bags, or fights, and alerts authorities. It achieves this by applying biopower by watching and having control over the larger population. The goal is fast response and fewer police patrols, keeping the city safe without heavy enforcement. The government sees it as a tool to maintain security and efficiency.

This system shows how technology can reduce crime and improve public safety. It reflects Singapore's high-tech governance, where AI and data help control the city. It also acts as a modern Panopticon; people behave and apply disciplinary power because they know they are being watched. This approach creates order with minimal visible policing yet still uses authority and governance. 

The system raises concerns about privacy and government overreach. Constant monitoring limits anonymity and personal freedom. AI-based policing may have biases, leading to wrongful suspicion. It also doesn't address the root causes of crime, like poverty or inequality, which prevents it from happening in public. Some fear it could create a culture of extreme conformity.
