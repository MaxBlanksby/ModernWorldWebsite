The companies Alibaba Ant Group and WeChat Pay created the Smile To Pay service. It is the software to walk into a store without a phone or wallet and the cameras surrounding the store will use facial recognition AI and pay for the items you have without any interactions. You simply “smile to pay” and leave the store. It holds importance in numerous Chinese grocery stores as it lessens the need for employees and makes it more convenient for users.

The purpose was to use the existing surveillance infrastructure in China to apply and make the systems more convenient experiences for customers. The customers intend to see the highly sophisticated surveillance and appreciate it, rather than feel violated of their privacy. The creators intended to make a product that is socially accepted using cultural relativism and useful for everyone.

The value of the object reflects the societal structure of China. People are so used to surveillance new technologies that are holding one’s information data that don’t pose any concerns to the citizens of China. It reflects the high amount of biopower and political socialization. Young children and everyone are exposed to this amount of surveillance and see it make their life safer and more convenient. They accept and internalize the government policies. 

The limitation of this object is the fact that it is limited to upper-class Chinese neighborhoods and societies. Not everyone is experiencing face-pay interactions at stores or accepting the surveillance they are under.
