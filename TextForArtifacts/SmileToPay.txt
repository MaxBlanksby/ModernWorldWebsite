The companies Alibaba Ant Group and WeChat Pay created the Smile To Pay service. It is the software that allows customers to walk into a store without a phone or wallet; the cameras surrounding the store use facial recognition AI to automatically charge the customer for the items they select. You simply “smile to pay” and leave the store. It holds importance in numerous Chinese grocery stores as it reduces the need for employees and makes transactions more convenient for users.  

The purpose was to leverage the existing surveillance infrastructure in China to create a more convenient customer experience. Customers tend to appreciate the highly sophisticated surveillance, viewing it as a benefit rather than an invasion of privacy. The creators intended to make a product that is socially accepted by applying <strong><em>cultural relativism</em></strong> and ensuring it was useful for everyone.  

The value of the object reflects the societal structure of China. People are so accustomed to surveillance and new technologies that collect personal data that they generally do not perceive it as a violation of privacy. It reflects a high degree of <strong><em>biopower</em></strong> and <strong><em>political socialization</em></strong>. Young children and everyone are exposed to this level of surveillance and see it as a means to enhance safety and convenience. They internalize the government policies and accept them as the norm.  

The limitation of this object is that it is largely confined to upper-class Chinese neighborhoods and societies. Not everyone is experiencing face-pay interactions in stores or accepting the surveillance they are under.
