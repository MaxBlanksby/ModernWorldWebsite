Susunu! Denpa Shōnen was a Japanese television show about a man living in an apartment with no human contact and was live-streamed 24/7 by Japanese producers, it aired in 2002 and lasted 15 months in Japan.  The idea was that the man named Nasubi was to start with no clothes or food and win everything through newspaper lotteries and deals until he amassed around ¥1,000,000 which is around $8000. 

The purpose was to entertain Japanese people, and it worked very well. It was the second most televised show in Japan when it aired and it had amassed a massive audience. The producers realized the novelty of constant surveillance this reveals one's true self when not in public or anything else, and that invasion of privacy is what drew so many people to watch the show. They exposed someone under no disciplinary power as they did not know they were being live-streamed at all times and had no social interaction the whole time. Similar to the Truman Show, the main character Nasubi acted as if he were alone and not being recorded the whole time as he was not aware of his circumstances.

The object marks a new age of entertainment, as live-streaming was a fairly new invention at the time. It shows the extreme that society will deem normal for the sake of entertainment and joy. Numerous human rights violations took place during this show, including holding a person captive with no clothes or food and no access to basic hygiene products. This is the idea of cultural relativism because Western Cultures would consider it inhumane in our society no one in Japan thought of it that way.

The show does not fully address the extent surveillance was working at the time. Of course, this show was an extreme case of surveillance used as entertainment and many other shows and things were much more moderate than Susunu! Denpa Shōnen.
