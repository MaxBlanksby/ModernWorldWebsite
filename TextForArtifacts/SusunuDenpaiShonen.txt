Susunu! Denpa Shōnen was a Japanese television show about a man living in an apartment with no human contact and being live-streamed 24/7 by Japanese producers. It aired in 2002 and lasted 15 months in Japan. The idea was that the man, named Nasubi, was to start with no clothes or food and win everything through newspaper lotteries and deals until he amassed around ¥1,000,000, which is around $8,000.  

The purpose was to entertain Japanese people, and it worked very well. It was the second most televised show in Japan when it aired, and it amassed a massive audience. The producers realized the novelty of constant surveillance—this revealed one's true self when not in public or around others. The invasion of privacy is what drew so many people to watch the show. They exposed someone under no <strong><em>disciplinary power</em></strong>, as Nasubi did not know he was being live-streamed at all times and had no social interaction for the entire duration. Similar to *The Truman Show*, the main character, Nasubi, acted as if he were alone and not being recorded the whole time, as he was not aware of his circumstances.  

The object marks a new age of entertainment, as live-streaming was a fairly new invention at the time. It shows the extreme that society will deem normal for the sake of entertainment and joy. Numerous human rights violations took place during this show, including holding a person captive with no clothes, food, or access to basic hygiene products. This reflects <strong><em>cultural relativism</em></strong>, as Western cultures would consider it inhumane, while in Japan, it was widely accepted entertainment.  

The show does not fully address the extent to which surveillance was working at the time. While this show was an extreme case of surveillance being used as entertainment, many other shows and events were much more moderate than *Susunu! Denpa Shōnen*.
