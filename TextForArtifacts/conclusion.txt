Surveillance has evolved from a tool of discipline and control to an unavoidable part of modern life. What began as theoretical concepts like the Panopticon and Big Brother has expanded into widespread technological systems, from CCTV and body cams to smart surveillance and digital monitoring. As society becomes more accustomed to being watched—whether for security, convenience, or entertainment—the line between protection and intrusion continues to blur. This exhibit invites us to reflect on the consequences of constant observation: does it make us safer, or does it reshape our sense of freedom in ways we have yet to fully understand?

And as you stand here, reading these words, remember—this space is watching you too. The cameras, sensors, and digital logs embedded throughout the exhibit ensure that you are not just an observer but also the observed. In the end, surveillance is not just something we study—it is something we live with, whether we notice it or not
