The phrase “Say Hi, You're on Camera” originates from mass-produced surveillance signs or stickers made by security companies or individuals to indicate the presence of surveillance systems. While its exact origin is unclear, it gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, aligning with the widespread adoption of CCTV and other monitoring technologies. The phrase became a common feature in public and private spaces, such as stores, parking lots, and workplaces, reflecting the normalization of surveillance in modern society. This artifact symbolizes a cultural shift towards embracing monitoring technology as a part of everyday life.  

The primary purpose of the sign is to deter criminal or undesirable behavior by reminding individuals they are being watched. It functions as a tool of surveillance to maintain order and protect property, using humor to soften the otherwise authoritarian nature of its message. The phrase targets the public, especially those considering breaking the rules or committing crimes in the monitored space. Tying back to the Panopticon and <strong><em>disciplinary power</em></strong>, it serves as a reminder that someone is watching and one should behave accordingly. By combining a casual and lighthearted tone with a clear warning, the sign reflects the creators' belief in the effectiveness of surveillance as a method of ensuring compliance and security.  

The sign shows how society has accepted surveillance as normal, highlighting <strong><em>cultural relativism</em></strong> that prioritizes safety over privacy. It reflects a time when monitoring technology became widespread and people began to self-regulate their behavior because they knew they were being watched. It highlights how power works through subtle control, making surveillance seem harmless or humorous.  

The sign ignores the negative effects of surveillance, like privacy violations or misuse of power. It doesn't address ethical concerns or how monitoring can unfairly target certain groups. The humor in the message distracts from the more serious issues of being constantly watched and doesn't question whether the surveillance is needed.
