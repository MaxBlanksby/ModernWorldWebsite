Body cam footage comes from small cameras worn by police officers or security personnel to record interactions with the public. These devices became widely adopted in the early 2010s in the US, particularly in response to demands for accountability and transparency in law enforcement. Body cams were introduced as a way to document events objectively, especially during high-stakes encounters, and are now used worldwide in many policing systems.  

The purpose of body cameras was to increase the safety of civilians and police officers and reduce complaints from civilians. The public was intended to see them when controversial police interactions happen. The creator decided that it would lessen controversy and mitigate arguments. Its purpose ties into <strong><em>identity politics</em></strong> because police brutality and other conflicts in the past catalyzed the use of this technology.  

Body camera footage reflects the <strong><em>social stratification</em></strong> of US police systems and the process of the individuals who become officers. Police officers needed surveillance to act and assert their <strong><em>disciplinary power</em></strong> on themselves and correctly apply their <strong><em>sovereign power</em></strong> to others. Society has an increasing need for surveillance as systems and jobs become more widespread. Less trust is being placed into the hands of police and instead placed in the surrounding technology.  

Body cameras are limited in their power, as police often work around them or choose to turn them off. While they have served as a crucial tool to observe police interactions and reveal the abuse of officers, in many cases, they can be turned off or have their ability to record limited. Additionally, body cameras are on constantly, meaning that in sensitive and domestic situations, they can leave people uncomfortable or unwilling to cooperate with police.
